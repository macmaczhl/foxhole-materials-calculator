## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the Foxhole Materials Calculator! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new vehicles, updating recipes, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
5. **Test thoroughly** before submitting

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality Requirements

- **Linting**: All code must pass `npm run lint`
- **Formatting**: Use `npm run format` to maintain consistent style
- **Testing**: Maintain 100% test coverage for new/changed code
- **TypeScript**: Keep strict type checking enabled

#### Required Validation Steps

Always run these commands before submitting changes:

```bash
npm run lint           # ESLint validation (must pass)
npm run format:check   # Code formatting check
npm test              # All tests must pass
npm run build         # Production build must succeed
```

#### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Write tests for all new functions and components
- **Place tests** in `src/__tests__/` with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- **Follow patterns**: Use existing test structure as examples
- **Test coverage**: Include both success and error scenarios
- **Mock dependencies**: Mock external APIs and complex dependencies

#### Adding New Materials

1. Add to appropriate enum in `src/lib/models.ts`
2. Add to `availableMaterials` array
3. Create recipes in `src/lib/recipes.ts`
4. Update `RecipiesByStuff` map
5. **Required**: Add comprehensive unit tests

#### Adding New Vehicles

1. Add to `Vehicles` enum in `src/lib/models.ts`
2. Create multiple recipes (garage vs mass production) in `src/lib/recipes.ts`
3. Add to `RecipiesByStuff` map
4. Add icon mapping in `src/lib/constants.ts`
5. **Required**: Write tests for all recipes and calculations

### Submitting Changes

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from main: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make focused changes**: Keep PRs small and focused on one feature/fix
3. **Test thoroughly**: Run all validation commands
4. **Write clear commits**: Descriptive commit messages
5. **Update documentation**: If your change affects usage
6. **Submit PR**: Include description of changes and testing performed

#### PR Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] New features have tests
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### Common Development Tasks

#### Manual Testing Scenarios

Always test these workflows after changes:

1. **Basic calculation**: Select "Construction Materials", set quantity 5, verify 50 Salvage
2. **Vehicle calculation**: Select "T3 Xiphos", set quantity 5, verify complex recipe tree
3. **Recipe switching**: Test different production methods in right panel
4. **UI responsiveness**: Verify layout works on different screen sizes

#### Debugging Tips

- Use `npm run dev` for hot-reload development
- Check browser console for React warnings
- Use Redux DevTools for state debugging
- Icons load from foxhole.wiki.gg - verify network connectivity

### Architecture Notes

#### State Management

- **Redux Toolkit** for complex calculator state
- **Immutable updates** using Immer (built into Redux Toolkit)
- **Typed selectors** for type-safe state access

#### Recipe System

- **Tree structure**: Recipes can depend on other recipes
- **Multiple options**: Each material can have various production methods
- **Calculation engine**: Handles scaling, excess tracking, and optimization

#### Component Architecture

- **Separation of concerns**: Components focus on UI, logic in services
- **Reusable components**: StuffIcon, StuffCombobox used throughout
- **Accessible design**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Deployment

The application automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are merged to main:

1. **GitHub Actions** runs lint and test validation
2. **Build process** creates static export in `./out/`
3. **Deployment** updates live site at https://macmaczhl.github.io/foxhole-materials-calculator/

#### Local Production Testing

```bash
npm run build    # Create production build
npm start        # Serve production build locally
```
